# Credit-Defaults
Credit defaults This project analyses patterns in credit default risk using financial and demographic data. It uses Excel to clean and organise the dataset, correlation tables, and create charts that highlight trends across income level, education level and prior loans. The goal is to identify key factors influencing defaults and provide insights to support better risk management and lending decisions.
